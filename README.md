# pallet

My attempt at containerization (get it - container but smaller is a pallet? Bazinga).

I want to write this using syscalls where I can. I won't **only** use syscalls as things like printf are very useful, but especially where it pertains to the actual containerization I want to rely entirely on syscalls if I can.
